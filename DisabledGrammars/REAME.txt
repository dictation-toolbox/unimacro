The python files in this folder are grammar files, but not active at this moment.

Sample grammars (like _first_sample_docstring.py and natspeak_sample_docstring.py are also in this directory.

You can make a grammar active by copying or moving the python file into the folder above: the unimacro folder.

After toggling the microphone the grammar should be active. Sometimes this will not work. Restart Dragon in that case.

Provided the unimacro folder is activated as userDirectory of natlink.

Deactivating goes the other way around.

Note for unimacro grammar files it is also possible to activate/deactivate my voice grammars, 
see the explanation on the grammar _control.
