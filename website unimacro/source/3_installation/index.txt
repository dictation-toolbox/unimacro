Installing and Configuring Natlink, including Unimacro and Vocola

 Please go to link(https://natlink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, natlink.readthedocs.io) which will lead you to: "Installing and configuring Natlink" (and then click on "getting started" and then on "Install").

-Note 1: the install of Vocola(2) is not completely approved yet.
-Note 2: although many many things in Natlink and Unimacro now work, a lot of things have changed, and - especially Quintijn Hoogenboom and Doug Ransom - are still working hard, together with developers "LexiconCode" and Dane Finlay to get Natlink and all sub projects (see for example link("https://dictation-toolbox.github.io/", Overview of Dictation Toolbox)) working.
