History of Natlink, Unimacro and Vocola

 Natlink

Natlink was written in 1999/2000 by Joel Gould, at that time working at Dragon Systems. 

He presented two important presentations about Natlink.

The first one is 
an link(NatLinkTalk.pdf, "Introduction to NatLink") (pdf, 236kb), and it gives an impression of the functionality of Natlink, and also an introduction of Python.

This talk is also available as link(natlinktalk.ppt, powerpoint) or link(natlinktalk.odp, OpenOffice Presentation).
 
 Unimacro
Was developed in the early 2000's by Quintijn Hoogenboom, with support from Bart Jan van Os and Ben Staniford.

Around 2010 Frank Olaf Sem-Jacobsen contributed several things, including a _latex grammar.

 Vocola

 Voicecode

The Voicecode project implemented a framework for programming by voice in different programming languages. In the preparation phase Joel Gould presented his talk for these 
link(VoiceCoders.pdf, "VoiceCoders, how to implement dictation into Natlink") (pdf, 180kb). For an explanation of the working of dictation grammars it is still an important source of information.

This talk is also available as link(voicecoders.ppt, powerpoint) or link(voicecoders.odp, OpenOffice Presentation).

The Voicecode project is regrettably obsolete. But files are still available at link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode/, SourceForge).
