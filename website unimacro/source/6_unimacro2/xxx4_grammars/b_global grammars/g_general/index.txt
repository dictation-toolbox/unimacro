Description of the _general grammar

In this grammar a lot of miscellaneous commands, (including some test commands) are brought together.

 Searching for characters
 
For starting a search, or a discrete continuation, this command can be used.  

The commands work together with the continuous  search  commands as described in 
link("/grammars/globalgrammars/repeat/searching.html", "repeat/searching"). See there for more information!

This is a vulnerable mechanism, should be investigated more.

 Highlight

:CODE:
highlight <dgndictation>
::

Searches for the dictated text. Started as a one shot application for Shane Delmore.

The meta actions bold(startsearch) and bold(startgo) possibly need fine tuning for some applications, see link(/features/actions/metaactions.html, *meta actions*).

 Format variables

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:Command
:COL:result
:ROW:
camel &lt;dgndictation>
:COL: "camel top down" gives "topDown"
:ROW:
camel back <1..5>
:COL:
the last <n> words are cameled
::

You need to specify which formatting is desired, you can choose your own spoken word like "camel" above.

You do this by editing the _general.ini config file, say "edit general", and fill in in section:
:CODE:
[formatvariable]
camel = camel
::

-The second word, after the bold("="), is the trick, which must be taken literally from the table below.
-The spoken word is before the bold("=").

:TABLE:
:HEADING:the trick
:COL:the action performed
:ROW:camel
:COL:  var like this -> varLikeThis
:ROW:studly
:COL:var like this -> VarLikeThis
:ROW:dotword
:COL:var like this -> var.like.this
:ROW:jive
:COL:var like this -> var-like-this
:ROW:score
:COL:var like this -> var_like_this
::


 Task switching
 
Is now moved to the link("/grammars/globalgrammars/tasks/index.html", "grammar *_tasks*")

 extracting information

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING: command
:COL: gives



:ROW:give window info|information
:COL: this information about the active window


:ROW:give user info|information
:COL: gives information about the current user, including BaseModel and BaseTopic

:ROW:give Unimacro info|information
:COL: gives information about Unimacro, version, base directory

::

 Hyphenate phrase (capitalized)
 
You can turn the last spoken phrase (or selected text), the last word or the last several words into all-capped hyphen separated text:
(command will be inserted in release 3.7foxtrot, and 3.8)
:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING: command
:COL: gives



:ROW:Hyphenate phrase
:COL:Hyphenates the last spoken phrase OR the selected text
:ROW:Hyphenate last (word | (2..5) words)
:COL:Hyphenates the last word or the last several words
::

Example:
:CODE:
John Smith becomes John Smith J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H
::

Note:
The clipboard is used by this macro, but previous contents are saved at the beginning of the macro and at the end restored again.
