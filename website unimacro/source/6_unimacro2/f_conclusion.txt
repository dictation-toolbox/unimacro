Conclusion

Finally: as long as you can manage with this, please go ahead.

If not, you might take the jump to the Python3 implementation.

It has been 4 years of development before "we" released a Python3 version, and we hope, it takes you less time to make the change. Please let us know, for example via mailto(q.hoogenboom@antenna.nl, Quintijn Hoogenboom).

With many thanks to especially Aaron Walker, Dane Finlay, Doug Ransom and Quintijn Hoogenboom.
