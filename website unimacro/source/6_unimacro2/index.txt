Natlink, including Unimacro and Vocola2

This version of Natlink is obsolete, but installation instructions are still presented here. But if possible, switch within some time to the Python 3 release!

:ROW:
NatLink is an OpenSource extension module for the speech recognition program Dragon.

In each Natlink with python2.7 release also Vocola and Unimacro are included.

Other packages, like Dragonfly, need Natlink in order to work with Dragon, but should be separately installed.

On this website are the instructions for *downloading and configuring Natlink*, including Vocola and Unimacro, and a more detailed description of *Unimacro*. For more about Vocola see the link(http://vocola.net/default.asp, *Vocola 2 website*).

*A stable release was released several years ago: link(/installation.html, release 4.2)*

This will also be the final release for Python 2.7.

Now (Augus 2024) also a fairly stable Python 3 release has been released. Please read on at link("/", "the home page of this site").
