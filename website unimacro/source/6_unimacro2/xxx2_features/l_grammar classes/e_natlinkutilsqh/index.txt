natlinkutilsqh

A lot of utility functions reside in this file some of which are reviewed in the following pages

For example 
-link(/features/grammarclasses/natlinkutilsqh/getfunctions.html, get functions), 
-link(/features/grammarclasses/natlinkutilsqh/moduleinfo.html, module and program info) and functions to see if a window matches certain requirements
-link(/features/grammarclasses/natlinkutilsqh/wordproperties.html, word properties), (must probably be revised with NatSpeak 11).

Also see in Miscelaneous the elaborated SetForegroundWindow function!
