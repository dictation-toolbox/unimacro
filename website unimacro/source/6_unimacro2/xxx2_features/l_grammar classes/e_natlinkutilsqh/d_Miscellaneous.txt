Miscelaneous functions 


 SetForegroundWindow
This important function for switching tasks has been elaborated (febr 2011). The Windows call  to *win32gui.SetForegroundWindow* often fails, because the active foreground window doesn't give up its focus.

This seems to have been tackled by an extra trick (if needed): get the Dragon bar in focus by sending the shortcut key _&#123;numkey*}_ and subsequent an _&#123;esc}_ key. It seems that after this has been done, the switching to the wanted window goes smooth. When this trick is used you see the NatSpeak menu flash up shortly.
