AutoHotkey

The program link(www.autohotkey.com, AutoHotkey) can perform many actions on your computer, in some cases smarter and more reliable than can be done with (the current knowledge) of Unimacro.

AutoHotkey actions can be called from Unimacro grammars, but also with the
link(/features/actions/shorthandcommands.html,  Unimacro Shorthand Command) *AHK*, which can also be called from Vocola.

 Installation and configuration
-Install link(www.autohotkey.com, AutoHotkey).
-(Re)start Dragon, with NatLink, Vocola and Unimacro or the option "Vocola takes Unimacro actions" enabled, in the NatLink config program.
-Try the Vocola examples below

At first call of any of the Unimacro AutoHotkey functions, Unimacro tries to locate the *autohotkey.exe* and the directory of script files (with extension *.ahk*):

- Unimacro expects *autohotkey.exe* in the "old style" program files directory, most often *C:\Program files*, and then in subdirectory *autohotkey*. Read the link(configuration) if you want them somewhere else.
- Unimacro expects or creates a user ahk scripts folder *AutoHotkey* in the users documents directory. Read the link(details) if you want them somewhere else.
- Some sample scripts are copied from the *sample_ahk* directory of Unimacro into this user ahk scripts directory, whenever these are newer. So when you mess up a script which is in the sample_ahk directory, delete it and restart Dragon.

 Script file or string
   
As script, you can either enter a filename (a AutoHotkey script, ending with *.ahk*), or the contents of the script. This is especially handy for one-liners.

-If a script or the text in the one-liner has that literary text *%hndle%*, the handle of the foreground window will be inserted in this place. This handle can be changed if the script is called from Unimacro, not via the *AHK* Unimacro Shorthand Command, see link(details). If this substitution happens in a script file, the script text is used and script file is not changed, because:

-If a script text is used, it is first written to *tempscript.ahk*, and then this script is executed with AutoHotkey. All script files are in the AutoHotkey directory of your user documents folder.

 Examples from Vocola
 
:CODE:
## Global vocola commands using AHK:
test paste = AHK("send ^v");
wheel (up=up|down=down) = AHK("send {wheel$1}");
wheel (up=up|down=down) 2..10  = AHK("send {wheel$1 $2}");
show messages = AHK(showmessageswindow.ahk);
testswitchback = RW() VW() AHK(showmessageswindow.ahk) VW() RTW();
::

-The first three send Keystrokes (including mouse actions), like the Dragon/VB SendKey command or the natlink.playString function. AutoHotkey has even more support for this, for example for handling the mouse wheel.
-Switching to another window with the python/win32gui function *SetForegroundWindow* is often unrelible. Luckily the AutoHotkey programmers do know how to do this task very reliable.
-The example *testswitchback* uses AutoHotkey functions also from within Unimacro. See link(details.html, details).
