Grammars

The different commands of Unimacro are ordered in grammar files, and they are located in different places.

We will make a distinction between link(control/index.html, "*_control*"), link(commongrammars, *Common grammars*) and more link(specialgrammars/index.html, *Special grammars*).

Each grammar file contains grammar rules, defining simple and more complex commands, and their corresponding actions whenever a command hits. Very common to grammar files are list of command words and corresponding actions. These lists can be configured via so called *ini files*. Read on for examples.


 Global grammars

Most Unimacro grammars are "global", meaning they are in principle active in each foreground application and/or dialog window. The grammar "click by voice" is global, but only "active" in one of the specified internet browsers.

Grammar files that start with a  *_* (underscore) are global. You can use commands from these grammars in any window/application (although the grammar may activate/deactivate itself or can be activated/deactivated in some cases).


 Specific grammars

Some of the grammars are "program specific" (or "application specific"). They are only active in the specified program or application. The name of the grammar file starts with the application name (the name of the .exe file). The few (partly obsolete) examples are listed in the link(specialgrammars, Special Grammars) page.

 Updating ini files
If you used some grammar before, but new options have been added, or options changed, you may have to update your configuration (.ini) file. See link(/features/inifiles.html, ini files section) for more instructions. (TODO)
