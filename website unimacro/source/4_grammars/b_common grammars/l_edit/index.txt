Edit text in DragonPad or even (for programmers) in emacs

*NOTE:* This grammar is a bit obsolete, because NaturallySpeaking introduced the dictation box several versions ago. Maybe the idea of the dictation box is even taken from this grammar!

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:edit that
:COL:copy the selection to DragonPad, for full Select-and-Say control

:ROW:edit all
:COL: copy the whole document to DragonPad, for full Select-and-Say control

:ROW:edit ready
:COL: in DragonPad: copy all text and paste back into the place it came from
::


The effects of these commands are the same as the dictation box in recent NatSpeak versions.  They work very well, and can have some side-effects:

-pasted text is automatically saved into text files (give the command *edit edit*, and edit the variables *automatic log to file*).  These files can be used for later analysis by the NatSpeak vocabulary builder. (The ini file variable *base log folder* is obsolete.)

 Logging and saving the messages window

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:action

:ROW:log (that|all)
:COL: the selection or the whole file is *logged* to a file (see below for the precise location)

:ROW:log messages
:COL: the messages window is copied into the special folder *log messages* in the Unimacro folder.  As a side effect the messages window is closed, so emptied.

::

 Files and folders the log files go to

-all log files go to subfolders of the Unimacro folder
-the files with the *log that* or *log all* command or the *automatic log to file* option on, go into the subfolder *log xxx/user* (xxx being the language code of your speech profile), and have names starting with *texts yyyy mm*, so each month the log file is refreshed.  For the *automatic log to file* behaviour of filenames start with *texts auto yyyy mm*.

(Note that the folder  *xxx_log* contains logs of all your utterances, if this option in the grammar *oops* is switched on)  

 Editing Latex code
 
Addition by Frank Olaf:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:edit (that|all) latex
:COL:sends the text to Microsoft Word with latex syntax highlighting

 Interaction with voicecoder

For programming purposes I experimented with different other commands.  The most important now is 

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:edit (that|all) (python|CC|...)  code
:COL:sends the text to a file, and open this file in emacs
::


The grammar *_lines* makes use of this, by the command word *emacs* as *simpleaction*.  

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command (*_lines grammar*)
:COL:comment

:ROW:20 lines emacs_
:COL: 20 lines are selected and brought to emacs, in correct emacs mode.

:ROW:lines 10 plus 20 emacs_
:COL:variants, see link(/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/index.html, *lines grammar*") and
link(/features/cooperationwithvoicecoder/index.html, *cooperation with voicecoder*)
