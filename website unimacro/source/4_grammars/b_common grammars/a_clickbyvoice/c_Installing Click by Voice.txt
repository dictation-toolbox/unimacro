A splendid chrome extension written by Mark Lillibridge.


This extension can be installed most easily by following the steps below:

-Also you can view this link(https://youtu.be/6qrjuTCX6Rw, demo video) on how to install this extension in chrome.

=Search for the extension "clickbyvoice"

Once you have this extension installed, you need voice recognition macro's in order to use the extension by speech.

In his page link(https://github.com/mdbridge/click-by-voice, click by voice), Mark Lillibridge shows you how to do this with Vocola commands.

It can also been done with commands in a Unimacro grammar, with is presented in link(/grammars/specificgrammars/chromebrowsing/index.html, this section) on this website. But first be sure you have properly activated the grammar:

 Activate grammar in Unimacro
 
By default this grammar is located in the subfolder *DisabledGrammars* of the Unimacro directory.
 
-Please copy the file *chrome_browsing.py* into the Unimacro directory.
-If the microphone is toggled with Chrome in the foreground, the grammar should be switched on.

Check that about the following text is printed in your "Messages from NatLink" window:
 
:CODE:
Cannot find inifile: (...)\enx_inifiles\chrome_browsing.ini
take sample inifile: (...)\sample_ini\enx_inifiles\chrome_browsing.ini
===Created new inifile for grammar "chrome_browsing"
===Please edit this file by calling the command "edit Chrome Browsing"
 IniGrammar switched on: chrome browsing
_control, added Unimacro grammar(s): ['chrome browsing']
::

So if you want to edit you options of this grammar, say *edit Chrome Browsing*.

Now you are switched on, and on the starting point of this video:
