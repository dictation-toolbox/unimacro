Common grammars

These grammars are automatically activated when Unimacro starts (when Natlink is started when Dragon is started).

Apart from the link(/grammars/control/index.html, *control grammar*), these grammars are located in the "UnimacroGrammarsDirectory", which is the "UnimacroGrammars" sub directory of the Unimacro directory inside the python system ("path/to/python/Lib/site-packages/unimacro/UnimacroGrammars"). Normally files in this directory are read only. So these grammars are for use only, not for editing.

In the pages in the left menu, the different common grammars are explained.
