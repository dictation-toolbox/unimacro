Going to and doing actions with lines

With the grammar *lines* you can easily jump to lines, numbered or relative to the current line, and perform additional actions.

-Lines can be selected, with or without line number
-Lines (numbered or relative) can have an additional action, like *delete*
-Lines can be moved or copied up or down or to another numbered line
-Selected lines can have the same actions by the keyword *THAT*
-For some programs: jump to *line numbers modulo hundred*
-Add some paragraph (para) commands (March 2016)

This grammar relies heavily on 
link(/features/actions/index.html, *actions*), 
because the keystrokes that perform the different actions are very different across different applications.  Implementations are now made or tried for Win32Pad, Excel, Emacs, Pythonwin, Komodo and UltraEdit.

 The grammar (basic, without translations or synonyms):

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:line {number}
:COL:Jump to the line. Relies on the grammar *number*, which is tested in English and Dutch

:ROW:line {number} {action}
:COL:Do an additional action, like *select*, *cut*, *copy*, *paste*, *paste over*, *duplicate* (see table below)

:ROW:line {number} through {number} [{action}]
:COL:select or do action on more (numbered) lines (you can change "through" to "to" with *edit lines* if you wish)'],
:ROW:line {number} plus {count} [{action}]
:COL:select or do action on more lines (first numbered)

:ROW:{count} lines {action}
:COL:Do action for more lines

:ROW:next|previous line [{action}]
:COL:goto or do action for next or previous line, so after or before the current line

:ROW:next|previous {1-20} lines {action}
:COL:Do action for more lines, after or before the current line

:ROW:{line definition} copy|move up|down {count}
:COL:copy or move the lines up or down

:ROW:{line definition} copy|move to {number}
:COL:copy or move the lines to the specified line number

:ROW:THAT {action}
:COL:instead of {line definition} also the keyword *THAT* can be taken
::


 Para actions, basically for Word:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:{count} paras {action}
:COL:Do action for more paragraphs

:ROW:next|previous  para {action}
:COL:Goto or do action for next of previous para, so after or before the current para

:ROW:next|previous {1-20} paras {action}
:COL:Do action for more paras, after or before the current para

:ROW:THAT {action}
:COL:instead of {para definition} also the keyword *THAT* can be taken
::


 Actions

Here is part of the list *simpleactions*, corresponding to *{action}* in above table:


:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:spoken form
:COL:action
:COL:comments
 
:ROW:copy
:COL:&lt;&lt;copy&gt;&gt;
:COL: the copy action is nearly always &#123;ctrl+c&#125;

:ROW:copy to DragonPad
:COL:HW copy that to DragonPad
:COL: actions do not have to be keystrokes
 
:ROW:cut
:COL:&lt;&lt;cut&gt;&gt;
:COL:

:ROW:delete
:COL:&lt;&lt;delete&gt;&gt;
:COL:

:ROW:duplicate
:COL:&lt;&lt;duplicate&gt;&gt;
:COL:

:ROW:edit
:COL:HW edit that
:COL: link this grammar to the grammar *edit*

:ROW:emacs
:COL:HW edit that python code, 'link to the grammar *edit*, see more information about see 
link(/features/cooperationwithvoicecoder/index.html,*connection with voicecoder *), including a little demo movie. A bit obsolete end 2013.
:ROW:end
:COL:&lt;&lt;endafterselection&gt;&gt;
:COL: leave the cursor at the end of line

:ROW:paste
:COL:&lt;&lt;homeafterselection&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;paste&gt;&gt;
:COL: paste, but prevent overwriting the selection here

:ROW:paste over
:COL:&lt;&lt;paste&gt;&gt;
:COL: paste over the selection

:ROW:select
:COL:
:COL:if you go to one line, this action selects the line. When you want more lines, this action does nothing extra.

:ROW:(un)comment
:COL:{alt+3} and {alt+4}
:COL: only for Pythonwin

 Line numbers modulo hundred
 
For some programs, who can "return" the current line number to this grammar with introspection, you can call "line numbers modulo hundred".

For example, when you are in line 1375, with "line eighty", you go to line 1380.

This feature has been implemented for a limited number of applications: *win32pad*, *excel*, *Visual Studio* (new, February 2021) and *Komodo* (a commercial IDE program, also new February 2021).  See:

-link(/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/implementationdetails.html, implementation details) for this grammar and 
-link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, programming details) about the action classes modules.

 Introspection

With the commands *show lines* and *edit lines* you can inspect the grammar and change things.
