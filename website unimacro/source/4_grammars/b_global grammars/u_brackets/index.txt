Brackets (put around text)

Note: this grammar is initially in the DisabledGrammars subdirectory of Unimacro. Copy the python file (_brackets.py) to the Unimacro directory, and switch the grammar on with the next command:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:switch (on|off) brackets
:COL: control the on/off state of this grammar.
::

 The grammar:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING width=40%:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:between {brackets}
:COL:insert brackets around the selected text, or simply put the brackets, with the cursor inside.
:ROW:between {brackets} &lt;dgndictation>
:COL:print your dictated text inside the brackets 

::

 Examples: 

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING width=40%:command
:COL:result ( | shows the cursor position after the command)

:ROW:between brackets hello world
:COL:(hello world)|
:ROW:between quotes Cap my favorite test period just kidding period
:COL:"My favorite test.  Just kidding."|

:ROW:between braces space-bar another thing space-bar
:COL:&nbsp;{another thing}&nbsp;|  (put a space before and after the braces)

:ROW:between angle brackets space-bar
:COL: &nbsp;&lt;|> (a special case, and insert a space *before the &lt;*. Position the cursor between the angle brackets.)

:ROW:between quotes brackets
:COL:"(|)"  (more brackets together, and puts the cursor in the middle)

:ROW:between HTML angle brackets 
:COL:&amp;lt;|>   (special case, if a *|* in a brackets definition, the cursor is put in the place of this vertical bar)

::



-If you put brackets around selected text, whitespace before or after the selection is maintained and put outside the brackets.
-If you dictate *space-bar* at the start or the end of the dictated text, a space will be inserted before or after, but outside the brackets.
-But note: first give the command words like *between brackets* or *between single quotes* etc.
-Control your own set of brackets by calling  *edit brackets* and editing the _brackets.ini configuration file (and see sample below).

 Warning
You cannot correct dictation errors when you use the &lt;dgndictation> imported rule. Select text that went wrong, and redictate. If then an error occurs, you can correct your dictate.

 Sample configuration file

:CODE:
[brackets]
angle brackets = <>
asteriscs = **
braces = {}
brackets = ()
colons = ::
double angle brackets = <<>>
double quotes = '""'
double underscores = ____
parens = ()
parenthesis = ()
quotes = '""'
single quotes = "''"
square brackets = []
triple quotes = '""""""'
underscores = __
vertical bars = ||
HTML square brackets = &#091;|]
HTML angle brackets = &lt;|>

[general]
initial on = 0


[grammar name]
name = brackets


[grammar words]
between = between
::

-Note the vertical bar to give the cursor position in case of asymmetric brackets.
-The grammar word *between* can have synonyms, for example *between = between | inside*
-When the grammar is switched on, you will see *initial on = 1*.
-For single and double quotes the definition must be double or single quoted, a peculiarity of the ini file mechanism.
