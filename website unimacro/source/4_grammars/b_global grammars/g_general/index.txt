Description of the _general grammar

In this grammar a lot of miscellaneous commands, (including some test commands) are brought together.

 Searching for characters
 
For starting a search, or a discrete continuation, this command can be used.  

The commands work together with the continuous  search  commands as described in 
link("/grammars/globalgrammars/repeat/searching.html", "repeat/searching"). See there for more information!

This is a vulnerable mechanism, should be investigated more.

 Highlight

:CODE:
highlight <dgndictation>
::

Searches for the dictated text. Started as a one shot application for Shane Delmore. Should be fine tuned for some application, see link(/features/actions/metaactions.html, *meta actions*), example at the bottom.

 Task switching
 
Is now moved to the link("/grammars/globalgrammars/tasks/index.html", "grammar *_tasks*")
