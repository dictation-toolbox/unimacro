Number dictation (_number simple)

-These number grammar rules can be used on its own (with this grammar), for example when dictating many numbers in your Excel worksheet.
-This grammar serves also as an example on how to use the number grammar rules in other grammars, like
link("/grammars/specificgrammars/firefoxbrowsing/index.html", "Firefox browsing") or
link("/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/index.html", "_lines"). 
-For more complex examples see link(number extended).
-For instructions of implementing in your own grammars, see link("Use in other grammars").
