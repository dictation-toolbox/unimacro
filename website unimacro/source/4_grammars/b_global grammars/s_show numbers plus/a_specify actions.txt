Specify actions

When you say *edit show numbers plus* (Dutch *bewerk sjoo numbers plus*), you get the configuration file in which you can specify additional actions. Current example:

:CODE:
[actions]
close = <<windowclose>>
refresh = <<taskrefresh>>
::

For the  first example you could have chosen:

:CODE:
close = {alt+f4}
::

But in some strange windows you need another keystroke combination to close it.

 Unimacro meta actions
 
The link(/features/actions/metaactions.html, Unimacro meta actions) mechanism makes this window specific behavior possible. 

 refresh
In the example of refresh (refreshing a window), use *&lt;&lt;taskrefresh>>*, all examples are in the actions.ini configuration file. 

Default is:


:CODE:
[default]
taskrefresh = {f5}
::

So with the  *{f5}* key you refresh an explorer or internet browser window.

For Outlook this meta action is defined as (thus send/receive your email):

:CODE:
[outlook]
taskrefresh = {f9}
::

For my special case of a *pythonw window* with *Unimacro* in the window title (titles converted to lowercase) I have:

:CODE:
[pythonw unimacro]
taskrefresh = {alt+s}{enter}
::

With this action I rerun my program, which happens to be the most repeated action of this program.

Feel free to experiment with your own applications!
