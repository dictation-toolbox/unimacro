Modes

This grammar is developed after a question of Angela Wigmore about making special modes for MathML and LaTeX.  For testing I included also a password mode.  

The grammar is global command but at start only the control rule is switched on.

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:command
:COL:comment

:ROW:&#123;mode&#125;  mode (on | off) 
:COL: switch on or off one of the modes

::

The modes are *normal*, *password*, *latex* and *math*.

If you switch on one of the modes, the rules for that specific mode are switched on, possibly exclusive.  See control variables at the top of the grammar.

 Password mode

This mode has defined the rules: &lt;letters&gt;, &lt;ucletters&gt; (upper case) and the numbers rule.

So you can say for example *alpha bravo Cap charlie delta* and *abCd* should appear.

The numbers rule is a more complicated one which needs probably the always the word *number* in front, so dictate *alpha number 2 Cap bravo number 2 hundred twenty three* to get *a2B223*.  As long as the mode is exclusive it is possible to experiment with leaving out the word *number*.
 
 The lists
The different rules can use lists, which must be filled.  This can be done in several ways:

- the *letters* are predefined in ICAlphabet (in the super class)
- the *number* parts are already defined in the superclass 
- the *operators* and the *Greek letters* (LaTeX and Math mode) can be defined in the ini file *_modes.ini*.  Study the examples.

 Translations
If you want to use the grammar in another language (Dutch, French), *command words* and *list words* have to be translated.  The Unimacro *IniGrammar*as this possibility, and most can be done in the appropriate *ini file*.  So if you go French, and you say the translated version of *Edit modes*, the French version of the inifile is opened, and you can put in all the translations of the grammar words and of the several list words.

For the *letters* some extra work probably has to be done in the superclass (natlinkutilsbj.py).

For the *number* part also extra work should be done, probably best first in the grammar _number. Most things should be adapted in the file natlinkutilsbj.py).

 Exclusive
If exclusive rules are used a few special functions should be included in order to stop the exclusive mode if the microphone is toggled.  See the source file for this.

 Repetition/quasi recursive rules
Note the careful way the *+* sign for the repetition of rules is used.  This way was adopted in the grammar *_keystrokes*.  As this grammar can hit very often, it should be switched off when you use modes in a non-exclusive way.  Be careful with changing this way of repetition.

 Reuse of (translated) ini files
If you make a better inifile than the previous one, in English or in another language, and you are on subverion (SVN), you can leave this one in appropriate subdirectory of *sample_ini*. After committing others can profit from this.
