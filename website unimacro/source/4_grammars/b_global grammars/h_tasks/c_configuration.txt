Configuration of tasks grammar

-Say _edit tasks_ to edit the properties of this grammar. 

 General options
 
In the section &#091;general] you can set a number of options:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=0:
:ROW:center mouse = T
:COL:Means after a task switch the mouse is positioned about 30% from the left top. (If set to *F* or *0* the mouse is not positioned at all.)

:ROW:initial on = 1
:COL: meaning this grammar is switched on when NatSpeak (and NatLink including Unimacro) starts.

:ROW:max icon number = 15
:COL: the number of icons you can call in the system tray. Set to *0* if you cannot want to call icons at all.

:ROW:max task number = 30
:COL: the number of tasks you want to call with the *task #* command. Set to *0* if you do not want to call tasks by numbers at all.

:ROW:max window number = 9
:COL: the number of windows inside an application you want to address. Set to *0* if you do not want to call windows inside an application with this command.

:ROW:switchapps = voice coder; pythonwin; emacs; dragonpad; edit; idle
:COL:

:ROW:enable search commands = T
:COL:special, search selection or word under the cursor in the wanted application eg *search two* or *search chrome*.
:ROW:split left right = 0.65<br>
split top down = 0.6
:COL:specify the proportion of the *task position* commands, eg *task two position right* takes less than half a screen and *task chrome position topleft* takes more than half a screen in both directions.

 Task starting/switching by name

You can set the list of applications you want to call with *task application* in the section 
&#091;application].

Examples:

:CODE:
[application]
calc = calc
calculator = calc
command = cmd
dragonpad = dragonpad
edit = edit
emacs = emacs
email = outlook
excel = excel
firefox = firefox; 2
idle = idle
internet = iexplore
komodo = komodo; 3
messages = messages
notepad = notepad
pythonwin = pythonwin
voice code = voicecode
voice coder = voicecode
winpad = win32pad
word = winword; 4
powerpoint = powerpoint
::

-Applications are further specified in the link(/features/actions/bringupdetails.html, *actions.ini*) configuration file, OR referenced to by a number, the task number on the taskbar.
- This number trick is only valid for fixed positions of tasks/applications on the taskbar. Separate the number and the application name by a *;*. Het

-The words on the right-hand side are builtin programs for Windows (like *outlook*), or are resolved in the link(/features/actions/actionsconfigurationfile.html, *actions.ini configuration file*). Each application that needs more tuning has there its own &#091;bringup app] section.
- In the case where the numbers trick is used, the name MUST match the application name.

-For example when *edit* is set to komodo, you can call *task edit* to bring komodo in front. *task komodo* works also in this example. For this *edit* example you cannot use the number trick.

:CODE:
[bringup edit]
name = komodo

[bringup komodo]
name = komodo
::


 Positioning the mouse after a task action

With the variable *center mouse* (in section *general* of the tasks inifile, say *edit tasks* to control this variable) you can enable or disable this feature.  It is demonstrated in the demo movie.

-With *centre mouse = T*   (or 1) the mouse is positioned 30% from the top left position of the active window.
-With *centre mouse = F*  (or 0) this positioning  is not done.
