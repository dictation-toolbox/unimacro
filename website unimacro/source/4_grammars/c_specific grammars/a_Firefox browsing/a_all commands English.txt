 The lists
 
-*tabcommands* and *pagecommands* can be configured from the configuration file: call *edit Firefox Browsing* to edit.

-The *number* list comes from a very complicated set of rules.  When you call *show Firefox Browsing* you get a complete list of the grammar rules, including the rules that catch the numbers.  Some small numbers do not react all the time.  You can call for example _follow 17_ as either _follow seventeen_ or _follow one seven_. Or _choose 123_ as _choose hundred twenty three_ or _choose one twenty three_ or _choose one two three_.
