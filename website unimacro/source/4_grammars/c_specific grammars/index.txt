Program specific grammars

The grammars described in this section are specific to one program.  

The python file starts with the name of the application, like *firefox_browsing.py*.

A lot of program specific things can be done outside these grammars:

-Vocola commands (see documentation of Vocola outside this website)
-adaptations in the grammar link("/grammars/globalgrammars/keystrokes/index.html", "*_keystrokes*"),
-adaptations of link("/features/actions/index.html", "*actions*").

At this moment specific grammars are only presented for
-link("chromebrowsing/index.html", "Chrome Browsing") (with Click by Voice),
-link("firefoxbrowsing/index.html", "Firefox browsing"),
-link("excel/index.html", "Excel") (work in progress).
