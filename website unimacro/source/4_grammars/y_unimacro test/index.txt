unittest Unimacro

The grammar *_unimacro_test.py* provides calls to unittest scripts, which do testing of part of Unimacro functionality.

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:

:ROW: Unimacro test all
:COL: do all the tests, but prompt for each test

:ROW: Unimacro test {tests}
:COL: do one of the tests, do not prompt.

If necessary the tests ask you relevant questions.  

The result of the tests is written into *testresult.txt" in the *unimacro_test* folder. This is a subfolder of the Unimacro folder, which also holds the tests.

 Writing new tests
 
If you want to make new tests put them in the subfolder "unimacro_test" of the Unimacro full.  Give them the name *XyzTest.py* and make the class that contains the tests the same name: *Xyztest*.

Restart NaturallySpeaking before you can call this new test.

The current test names are presented in the pages below.
