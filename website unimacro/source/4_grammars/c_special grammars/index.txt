More special grammars

These are located in a sub directory of the Unimacro directory inside the python system ("path/to/python/Lib/site-packages/unimacro/OtherUnimacroGrammars").

When you want to use one or more of these grammars, please configure a UserDirectory via the "Configure Natlink via CLI" command "n". Take for example ~\Documents\UserDirectory.

Then copy the wanted grammars from the path above to this UserDirectory. Restart Dragon, and you will (hopefully) be in.

Hint: when you want to locate the "path/to/python/Lib/site-packages/unimacro" directory, type "i" in the "Configure Natlink via CLI", and you will see the path to the UnimacroDirectory. The OtherGrammarsDirectory is a sub directory of this Unimacro directory.
