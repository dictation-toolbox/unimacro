Installing wxPython via pip:

   (pip is the easiest way to install python modules)

   (open a command prompt in admin mode, Start menu, type cmd, right click on cmd.exe and choose Run as administrator;

   (first go to the Scripts directory of python2.7:

C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd \python27\Scripts

   (then get the version of pip, which should be python 2.7)
C:\Python27\Scripts>pip --version
pip 18.1 from c:\python27\lib\site-packages\pip (python 2.7)

   (then install or upgrade wxPython)
   (if it is the first time install, leave away --upgrade)

C:\Python27\Scripts>pip install --upgrade wxPython
Requirement already up-to-date: wxPython in c:\python27\lib\site-packages (4.0.3)
