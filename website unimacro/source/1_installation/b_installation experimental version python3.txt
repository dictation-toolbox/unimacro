Installation of Natlink/Vocola 2/Unimacro Experimental Release with Python 3
Vocola and Unimacro work well on the development branch but you are may come across the odd bug.  

-Download and install the latest 3.8 32-bit Python  from link(https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/299, "Python 3.8  latest version") (Select Add to path install option, and Install FOR ALL USERS.  Save 
yourself some grief and install it at the root of  your c: drive, like c:\python38-32).  If you already have a python 3.7 32 bit installation you can use that.
At this time, do not create a link(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) Virtual Environment. They do not work with Natlink.

 
-Packages are now all in the dictation-toolbox in github, for packages that are not packaged for pip installation, 
I recommend cloning the wanted repositories in one base directory, for example *C:\DT*
Instructions below install the source from GIT.   Select a folder to host your natlink, unimacro, dragonfly, etc.  Below the example is C:\DT but it can be anything.


-Exit dragon

- Download the source from GIT 

--git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/natlink.git (In your preferred directory eg *C:\DT\Natlink*. We will assume C:\DT in the instructions below. )
--If you want Unimacro: git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/unimacro.git (into *C:\DT\Unimacro*)
--If you want Vocola: git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/vocola2.git (into *C:\DT\Vocola*) (Vocola2 being the Vocola version for Dragon/Natlink)
if you want the development branch of   Dragonfly and Caster, clone from their git repositories.  Otherwise install them using pip (see below).

-Install the python package  prequisistes:

-Start menu -> cmd (start in admin mode).  Powershell also will work.
Change directory to C:\DT\Natlink\ConfigureNatlink

This will install the python prerequisites for natlink, vocola, and unimacro
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will instal the prequsiites for  caster and dragonfly.  you can skip this is you are installing those with pip:
pip install -r caster_requirements.txt


Main install instructions, targeted to Caster (as given by LexiconCode):
 

-Probably you can go to 
-cd C:\DT\Natlink\ConfigureNatlink (With C:\Natlink being your preferred directory)
-and run start_configurenatlink.py  (by typing python start_configurenatlink.py)

(if this fails):
-Start menu -> cmd -> Run as Administrator
-cd C:\Natlink\Natlink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro (Could be any preferred directory)
(so in in elevated cmd window cd to directory where you cloned natlink)
-cd C:\DT\Natlink\ConfigureNatlink
-python start_configurenatlink.py (Requires administration rights)

(and when the wxpython GUI window doesn't want to start)
-run start_natlinkconfigfunctions.py (which will ask for elevation), or
-python natlinkconfigfunctions.py (in elevated mode),

 In the config GUI:
-Click enable Natlink
-Click enable UserDirectory
-Choose Caster directory as user directory
-reboot (maybe not needed)
-restart dragon

 In the natlinkconfigfunctions:
-press *e* (enable Natlink)
-sometimes you need "r" (reregister Natlink)

 Vocola and Unimacro:

-In the config GUI or natlinkconfigfunctions.py (CLI) enable these packages. (With the CLI, type *u* for Usage).
