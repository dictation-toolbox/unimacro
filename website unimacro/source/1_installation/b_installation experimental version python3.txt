Installation of Natlink/Vocola 2/Unimacro Experimental Release with Python 3

A lot of work has been done in the migration from python2 to python3, although at a fairly slow pace.

A year ago, (October 1, 2021) I wrote: Natlink is reasonably stable. But Unimacro and Vocola do NOT run yet with Python3.

By now, at the beginning of November 2022, we will release again a pre release for python3, which will be pretty far into the right direction!

-When you use Unimacro and/or Vocola(2), please stick to the link(/installation/installationstableversionpython2.html, Python2.7 release), as is published on sourceforge.

When things are not clear, please use the communication channels, like link(https://gitter.im/dictation-toolbox/natlink, gitter), or let met know: mailto(q.hoogenboom@antenna.nl).
