Installation of Natlink/Vocola 2/Unimacro Experimental Release with Python 3
Vocola and Unimacro work well on the development branch but you are may come across the odd bug.  

-Download and install the latest 3.8 32-bit Python  from link(https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/299, "Python 3.8  latest version") (Select "Add to path" install option, and "Install FOR ALL USERS".  Save 
yourself some grief and install it at the root of  your c: drive, like *c:\python38-32*).  If you already have a python 3.7 32 bit installation you can use that.
(At this time, do not create a link(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) Virtual Environment. They do not work with Natlink.)

 
-Packages are now all in the dictation-toolbox in github. For packages that are not packaged for a pip install, 
we recommend cloning the wanted repositories in one base directory, for example *C:\DT*
Instructions below install the source from GIT.   Select a folder to host your natlink, unimacro, dragonfly, etc.  Below the example is *C:\DT* but it can be anything.

-Exit dragon

- Download the source from GIT 

--bold(git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/natlink.git) (In your preferred directory eg *C:\DT\Natlink*. We will assume C:\DT in the instructions below. )
--If you want Unimacro: git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/unimacro.git (into *C:\DT\Unimacro*)
--If you want Vocola: git clone git@github.com:dictation-toolbox/vocola2.git (into *C:\DT\Vocola*) (Vocola2 being the Vocola version for Dragon/Natlink)
--If you want the development branch of Dragonfly and Caster, clone from their git repositories.  Otherwise install them using pip (see below).

-Install the python package prequisistes:
--Start menu -> cmd (Command prompt) and *Run as administrator*).  Powershell also will work.
--Change directory to *C:\DT\Natlink\ConfigureNatlink*
--This will install the python prerequisites for natlink, vocola, and unimacro: *pip install -r requirements.txt*

--This will instal the prerequisites for  caster and dragonfly.  You can skip this when you install those with pip:
*pip install -r caster_requirements.txt*


 Main install instructions, targeted to Caster (as given by LexiconCode):

-When you have no Command prompt yet: Start menu -> cmd (Command prompt) -> *Run as Administrator*

 
-Probably you can now go to:  *cd C:\DT\Natlink\ConfigureNatlink* and run start_configurenatlink.py, by typing *python start_configurenatlink.py*.
-In the config GUI:
--Click enable Natlink
--Click enable UserDirectory
--Choose Caster directory as user directory
--Quit the GUI

-When the wxpython GUI window doesn't want to start: run the script natlinkconfigfunctions.py by typing *python natlinkconfigfunctions.py* (when you are already in elevated mode) or *python start_natlinkconfigfunctions.py* (elevation is asked for).
-In the natlinkconfigfunctions:
--press *e* (enable Natlink)
--sometimes you need *r* (reregister Natlink)
--press *n caster_directory* for enabling the UserDirectory and setting it to the Caster directory
--press *q* to quit

-Then restart dragon
-- In some rare cases a reboot is required.



 Vocola and Unimacro:

-In the config GUI or natlinkconfigfunctions.py (CLI) enable these packages. (With the CLI, type *u* for Usage).
