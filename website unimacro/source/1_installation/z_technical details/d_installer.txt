Installer 

Using the installer program (with inno setup) is not very difficult. It is controlled from the python script 
*setupnatlinkwithinno.py*, which resides in *NatLink/natlinkInstaller*. 

You need the program link("http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php", "*inno setup*") on your computer, and you need to have both NatLink and Unimacro files via subversion (SVN).


 Local actions:
 
Do the following steps:
-change __version__ in natlinkstatus (Core directory)
-Update Unimacro and NatLink
-Commit NatLink
-Export (a SVN command) both Unimacro and NatLink into a new folder (eg *D:\NatLink\releases\natlink4.0*)
-This folder then has subfolders *NatLink* and *Unimacro*!
-Run the script *setupnatlinkwithinno.py* from the file in this directory (*D:\NatLink\releases\natlink4.0\NatLink\natlinkInstaller*)

The resulting setup....exe will be created in a directory *dist*  (*D:\NatLink\releases\natlink4.0\dist*) and will be called 
*setup-NatLink-4.0.exe* (*4.0* being the release number).

 Going to sourceforge

-Next you must go to *http://sourceforge.net*. 
-Login and search for *natlink*.
-Go to the files section and follow the instructions.
-Upload the *.exe* file.
-You also need a *README.txt* file, which shows a short instruction on the relevant download page.
