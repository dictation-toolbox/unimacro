NatLink Core Functions

This module *natlinkcorefunctions.py* is in the *Core* directory.

The functions are used by natlinkstatus.py,
and can also used by other modules.

The most important are:

 getExtendedEnv
 
You can use this function for expanding *~* or *%HOME%* to your personal home directory, or for other%XXXX% variables.

Note: By default for *~* or *%HOME%* the value of *%PERSONAL%* is taken, which points to the default documents directory of the user that is logged in (*%USERPROFILE%\Documents*). If you want another value for *%HOME%* (and therefore for *~*), you can specify this via the Environment Variables menu in the System Properties program. See an link(https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx, example).

Starting September 2015 also the actual NatLink directories can be expanded, with a similar function in *natlinkstatus.py*. For usage and examples, please see link(natlinkstatus).
