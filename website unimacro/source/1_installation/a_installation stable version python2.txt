   Installing Python2.7.14

-Download link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.7.14/python2.7.1.exe/download, *Python 2.7.14, needed for Natlink*).
--This is a self-extracting zip file, with extension .exe.
--This is nearly the latest release of python 2.7.

   Installing Python2.7.18
-Or better, go to link(https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/, python download site), and download the *Windows x86 MSI installer*.
--Warning: Natlink does not work when you install a "64 bit" python version. So *DO NOT USE* the Windows x86-64 MSI installer.
-Install *for all users*, which is the default
-You now need to install four additional packages, *pywin32*, *wxpython*, *six* and *future*
-You can do this best via *pip*, please follow the link(Installing packages via pip.pdf, *pip instructions*) (pdf 147kb).

   Download and install Natlink/Vocola 2/Unimacro

-Download the combined installer as given above.of
-Run the downloaded file.
-Install on *C:\Natlink* (or *D:\Natlink* or any other drive of your choice). Installing in "C:\Program files\Natlink" is *NOT* advised.

 Directory layout after installation
 
When you installed at *C:\Natlink* you will get the following directory structure:
-Natlink and Vocola 2 are in *C:\Natlink\Natlink*,
-Unimacro is in *C:\Natlink\Unimacro*
-User defined grammars can be in any location, for example *C:\NatlinkUserDirectory* or *C:\Natlink\UserDirectory*.
--You can put your *Dragonfly* grammar files, python files, in this directory.
--Dragonfly should be installed separately.
-The core directory is *C:\Natlink\Natlink\MacroSystem\core* (the "controlling" Natlink files are located here)
-Internally the compiled Vocola 2 files will go in *C:\Natlink\Natlink\MacroSystem*.
--This is the baseDirectory of Natlink.
--Do not put anything else in this directory, although it will not prevent Natlink from functioning.
-In case you cannot find your configuration program (the GUI): it is located in *C:\Natlink\Natlink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro*.
--The configuration (GUI) program is the file "configurenatlink.pyw".
--In order to run elevated mode, you should start the script *start_configurenatlink.py* in the same directory.
-Elevated mode is only needed the first time you run the configure program, and when you want to enable/disable Natlink or when you want to unregister or (re)register *natlink.pyd*.
--But... it does no harm to always start the config program in elevated mode.
