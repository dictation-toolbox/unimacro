Technical details

The pages in this section provides more details about some technical issues. They will be revised when time goes.

 Dragon 11

With Dragon 11 several changes made quite a few adaptations in NatLink and Unimacro necessary. The details can be found in the different unittest programs (in the PyTest directory of NatLink). 
But the most important changes are:

-Word properties are no longer returned by NatLink, but...
-A new word format makes extracting a lot of properties possible (see link(/installation/technicaldetails/nsformat.html, *nsformat*)).
-The imported rules &lt;dgnletters> and &lt;dgnwords> are no longer recognized. Only &lt;dgndictation> remains. (This is the equivalent of &lt;_anything> in Vocola.)
