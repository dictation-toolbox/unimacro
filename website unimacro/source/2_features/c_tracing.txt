The tracing mechanism

Tracing can be exploited for debugging things.  Presently I use it most if actions are not working well.

Use the command:

        Trace Actions (On | Off | 1 to 9)
        
Each number gives more information and longer pauses between each action/part of the action (including keystrokes).

If things continue to go too slow, do not forget to switch off the trace again.
