Unicode characters

With the Unimacro shorthand command *U* you can paste most *unicode characters* to your screen, like *Alpha*, *eacute* etc. In this way with Dragon NaturallySpeaking Unicode characters can be printed in virtually any program.

In Vocola you can choose between quotes (*"U delta"*) or parenthesis:  *U(delta)*.

 See link(/features/unimacroandvocola/unimacroshorthandcommands.html, "section on Vocola and Unimacro) when you want to use Unimacro Shorthand Commands in Vocola.


Simply put in aVocola commands file: *"U delta"* or *U(delta)*. 

Or put in some action in some grammar: *action('U delta')*.

As a test put the following in your local (for example Word) or global commands file:

:CODE:
test command = 
"{enter}Delta (as 0394): " U(0394)
"{enter}Delta (as 394):" U(394)
"{enter}Delta (as Delta):" U(Delta)
"{enter}alpha (as alpha):" U(alpha)
"{enter}alpha (as 03B4):" U(03B1)
"{enter}Pi (as 03A0):" U(03A0)
"{enter}Pi (as 3a0):" U(3a0)
"{enter}Pi (as Pi):" U(Pi)
"{enter}wrong spades (??, other font?):" U(2660)
"{enter}Cyrillic capital letter NJE:"  U(040A)
"{enter}eacute:;" U(eacute)
"{enter}unicode ETH (as U ETH):;" U(ETH)
"{enter}ascii ETH (as A 208):;" A(208)
"{enter} ETH (as U d0):;" U(d0)
"{enter} ETH (as U 00D0):;" U(00D0)
"{enter}";

 Note the bottom 5 examples stop at eacute. This is a little mistake which will be corrected in the next version of Unimacro.

 Graham Cole contributed the following list. It (or part of it) can be included in a Vocola commands file (say *edit global commands* or *edit commands* for some application)

 Combining with other things

Next example shows how you can surround the Right Arrow Sign by spaces:

:CODE:
Right Arrow Sign = {space} U(rarr) {space};
