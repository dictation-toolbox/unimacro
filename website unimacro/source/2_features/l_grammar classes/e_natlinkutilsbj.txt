In this file the class definitions of about three classes reside.

-new function August 2011: GetGrammarObject(name):

Returns the grammar instance (of some Unimacro grammar - already loaded -), where name is the name as pronounced, and defined as *name* in the section [grammar name] of the grammar. 

Through this mechanism one grammar can call another, preferably earlier loaded, module.

See example in _lines with *enable search commands*
