Dictation-toolbox


The Dictation-toolbox is a collection of "tools" that help speech recognition.

Some projects are centered around the Speech Recognition (SR) program "Dragon", which runs on Windows. The "Natlink" project plays a central role as "glue" between Dragon and the OpenSource projects as Vocola, Dragonfly (with Caster) and Unimacro.

Other projects are aiming at other SR programs, other operating systems.

All these projects are OpenSource, under the ... License.
