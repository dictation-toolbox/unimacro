For developers

Developers can clone dt-projects, projects from the Dictation Toolbox.

In Windows, a good strategy could be, to make a common directory which can hold each project as a separate subdirectory.

Each of the DT repositories can be cloned in such a subdirectory.

So... go to link(https://github.com/dictation-toolbox), and choose the project you want to clone.
