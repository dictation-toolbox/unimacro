For all definitions you can now also use the Windows system environment variables.  Enclose with _%_ and *all capitalise* them.  Its sensible use is to put them at the front of a file, folder or virtual drive definition. Slashes can be omitted.

 Examples:

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:

:HEADING:Variable
:COL:Meaning

:ROW:%HOME%

~
:COL:pointing to your home folder, most often your path to My documents, see below

Tilde is a common shorthand notation for your home folder. 

:ROW:%PROGRAMFILES%
:COL:pointing to the program files folder

:ROW:%APPDATA%
:COL: pointing to your app data folder

:ROW:%DESKTOP%
:COL: pointing to your desktop folder

 Natlink related Environment Variables
 
Starting with version 4.1whiskey also Natlink related environment variables are added. The interface is a bit tricky, but the _folders grammars uses them.

:TABLE firstcoldifferent=1, border=1:
:HEADING:Variable
:COL:Example value
:ROW:%BASEDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem
:ROW:%COREDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core
:ROW:%DNSINIDIR%
:COL:C:\ProgramData\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking15
:ROW:%DNSINSTALLDIR%
:COL:C:\Program Files (x86)\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking15
:ROW:%DNSUSERDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\ProgramData\Nuance\NaturallySpeaking15\Users\QNederlands\current
:ROW:%NATLINKDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\NatLink\NatLink
:ROW:%UNIMACRODIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\NatLink\Unimacro
:ROW:%UNIMACROUSERDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\Documenten\unimacro_qh
:ROW:%USERDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\UserDirectory\dragonfly-macros
:ROW:%VOCOLAUSERDIRECTORY%
:COL:C:\Documenten\vocola_qh

 HOME and ~
The environment variable *%HOME%* is by default NOT set in Windows.  In order to make the story above work, Unimacro takes for *%HOME%*: the *My documents* folder on your system.

Of course you can also set *%HOME%* yourself (in System properties, Advanced, Environment variables). 
When you are using Emacs (VoiceCode) you probably have set the *%HOME%* variable this way in order to get proper access to your *.emacs* file.

For *~* also this folder is taken.

 Show all these variables
 
You can show all the Environment variables and the Natlink specific variable via a Unimacro Shorthand Command. In Vocola you can enter in your (global) command file:

:CODE:
print all variables = Unimacro("PRINTALLENVVARIABLES");
print natlink variables = Unimacro("PRINTNATLINKENVVARIABLES");
