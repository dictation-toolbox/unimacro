The python files in this folder are grammar files, but not active at this moment.

The usable and - as much as possible - maintained grammars are in UnimacroGrammars. See for activating them the instructions there.

Sample grammars (like _first_sample_docstring.py and natspeak_sample_docstring.py are also in this directory, and test things from the past are in this directory.
