Working with subversion (SVN)

   Migration to new repositories

 Summary

The new repositories for the projects NatLink, Unimacro and Voicecode are:
-NatLink: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/natlink/code
-Unimacro: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/unimacro/code
-Voicecode: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/voicecode/code

In all three cases you will be prompted for username (sourceforge id) and password. I am not aware of an anonymous login possibility. 

Below, first see more detailed instructions on how to change the repository in case you were already on subversion for (some of these) projects.

Then there is more explanation for new subversion users.

 Unimacro

Unimacro has on February 12, 2013 been moved to a new location. See new address above and more details below. For those who were on subversion forUnimacro before can simply do a "relocate":

Then enter the new location (please type in, no paste): *https://svn.code.sf.net/p/unimacro/code* 


 NatLink

NatLink has been moved to a new location (10 March 2013). Subversion update seems to work as normal, but when you commit things you will get the following message (assuming you use TortoiseSVN):

image(subversion error message natlink.png, title=NatLink subversion error message)

You can do a simple subversion relocate to:

image(subversion natlink relocate.png)

Then enter the new location (please type in, no paste): *https://svn.code.sf.net/p/natlink/code*  


 VoiceCode

The same for voicecode (10 March 2013). Do a subversion relocate, and choose:

 https://svn.code.sf.net/p/voicecode/code

When all is succesfull, after having been prompted for your sourceforge password, you will get the following message:

   Why and how to work with subversion


If you want more recent versions of files than the latest release, or if you want to contribute to NatLink, possibly Vocola, or Unimacro, you should get your files from SourceForge with subversion. 

-First you need a sourceforge id (USERNAME and password), as far as I know no anonymous checkout is possible. Goto link(http://sourceforge.net/, sourceforge) and click on  *join* top right.

-Then get Tortoise SVN from link("http://tortoisesvn.net", "tigris tortoisesvn").

-Now remove the subdirectories of *Unimacro* and *NatLink* (in case of getting both with SVN) or either one of them. Leaving you in *C:\NatLink*. (Another starting point, like D:\NatLink is also possible and even recommended.)

These were the preliminaries. Now proceed:

-So now assume the root of NatLink is in *C:\NatLink*. And you have removed one or both subdirectories *NatLink* and *Unimacro*.
 NatLink

-For *NatLink*: right click on *C:\NatLink* and choose *SVN checkout*. 
-Fill in for URL of repository (please type in, no paste): *https://svn.code.sf.net/p/natlink/code*   
-choose for checkout directory *C:\NatLink\NatLink* 
-you are probably prompted twice for loging (sourceforge id) and password

 Unimacro

-For *Unimacro*: also right click on *C:\NatLink* and choose *SVN checkout*: 
-Fill in as repository (please type in, no paste): *https://svn.code.sf.net/p/unimacro/code*,
-choose as checkout directory *C:\NatLink\Unimacro*,
-you are probably prompted twice for loging (sourceforge id) and password

image("checkout Unimacro.png",alt="checking out Unimacro with SVN (subversion)")

 Voicecode

-Similar actions are needed to get Voicecode: right click on *C:\NatLink* and choose *SVN checkout*:
-Fill in as repository (please type in, no paste): *https://svn.code.sf.net/p/voicecode/code*,
-choose as checkout directory *C:\NatLink\Voicecode*,
-you are probably prompted twice for loging (sourceforge id) and password

image("checkout Voicecode.png",alt="checking out Voicecode with SVN (subversion)")

Note: checking out Voicecode takes quite some time, you will be seeing the following for some time:

image("voicecode checkout takes some time.png",alt="checking out Voicecode takes some time")


 Directory layout

After checking out NatLink (which includes Vocola), Unimacro and Voicecode (only for voice coders), you will see the following directory layout:

image("directory layout after subversion checkout.png",alt="directory layout after subversion checkout")


 Vocola:
Note the Vocola files are in the NatLink repository.

 Update

For updating you can right click on one of the folders and choose *SVN update*. You should do a separate Update for each of the three folders (if you checked them out).

 Contribute: Commit

If you want to commit changes (contribute to one of the projects):
-You probably are registered at link("http://sourceforge.net/account/registration/", "SourceForge.net") by now,
-You need to get permission from one of the repository administrators to do so. Mail to Quintijn, see email link at the bottom of this page.

If that has been done, you can also commit 
changes by right clicking on the correct folder and choose *commit*. Your password for SourceForge will be asked once.

   How to find *configurenatlink.py* or *natlinkconfigfunctions.py*

In case you checked out things in different folders, or didn't install the .exe installer before you took above steps, you will have to find the configure GUI or the configure command line interface in the Windows explorer.

Go to *C:\NatLink\NatLink\confignatlinkvocolaunimacro*.

-With the python file *start_configurenatlink.py* you can start the config program, in "elevated" mode. Just run this python file
-With the file *start_natlinkconfigfunctions.py* you start the command line interface, also in elevated mode. (See link(/installation/technicaldetails/natlinkconfigfunctions.html, "instructions on natlinkconfigfunctions").
