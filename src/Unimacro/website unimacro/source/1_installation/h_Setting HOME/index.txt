Configure environment variables

For some grammars and for some configure tricks in the configure program (not the config GUI though) you can use environment variables.

The most important one is *HOME*, also the shorthand notation *~* is used.

-When HOME is not set explicitly, the value of *PERSONAL* is taken, on my system for example pointing to "C:\Users\Quintijn\Documents"

 Setting your HOME variable
    
-When you want to set *HOME* to a user independent directory, you need to set the HOME environment variable, see below (the pictures are from a Dutch Windows 7 computer):

-Go to the *System properties* (Press Windows+Break key):

image(systemproperties.jpg, displayscale=0.7)

-Click on *Advanced Settings* and in the next dialog click on *Environment variables*

image(advancedsettings.jpg, displayscale=0.7)


-Note HOME can be configured already, like in this example:

image(homeinenvironmentvariables.jpg, displayscale=0.7)

-If it is not, click on *New*, and edit like:

image(makenewenvironmentvariable.jpg, displayscale=0.7)

Now you can, probably after a restart of Dragon, use *~* or *%HOME%* for your HOME directory!
