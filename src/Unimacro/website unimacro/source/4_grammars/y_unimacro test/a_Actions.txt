unittest Actions

In the file *ActionsTest.py* (of the subfolder *unimacro_test* of the Unimacro folder) are brought together tests that test the actions mechanism of Unimacro.

Tested are:
-The handling of arguments of actions (conversion from text into numbers)
-The return values, so sometimes an action breaks off halfway.
-The timing of the *W* (Wait) action.


Running this test (by calling *Unimacro test actions*) can always be performed, as long as DragonPad is not (active and nonempty).
