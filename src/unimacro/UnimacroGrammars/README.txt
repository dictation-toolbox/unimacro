The python files in this folder are grammar files, which are activated, when starting Dragon with Natlink and Unimacro enabled.

These are the most common Unimacro grammars. They can be activated or deactivated by voice, through commands of the _control grammar.

In other directories are more special or older (possibly obsolete) grammars and demo grammars.

When you want to activate these, specify with the config program a natlink userdirectory, and copy the grammars into this directory. (See the contents of the file natlink.ini)

Note for unimacro grammar files it is also possible to activate/deactivate the grammars by voice commands as defined in _control.
