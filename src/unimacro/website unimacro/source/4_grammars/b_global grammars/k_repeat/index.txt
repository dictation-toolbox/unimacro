repeat, moving the cursor, mouse and search and repeating the last command

With this Grammar automatic movements can be made.

 This grammar is in revision, contact Quintijn if you want the files/cooperate!

-moving the cursor, in all directions, a number of steps or at a variable speed.
-moving the mouse, ditto
-repeating the last search
-repeating the last command (a bit more vulnerable than the other commands)

This grammar is based on Joel Gould's _mouse.py and Jonathan Epstein's
version of _generic_movement.py.

 Moving the cursor

Start moving with: 
:CODE:
Start (Moving|Selecting|Scrolling) (<speed>|<direction>|<count>)+
::
with:

:CODE:
speed = steady | slow | fast | very slow | very fast
direction = up | down | left | right 
            but also: (page | paragraph | line) (up | down) or 
            word left | word right
count = 1 to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40
::
more directives can be spoken in one command (the + sign after the parens).

When moving you are in the so-called exclusive mode: only commands described below our recognised.  An icon is shown in the system tray, and moving can be stopped by

    stop | OK
    
Moreover the movement can be controlled by commands like:

    another speed
    acceleration: faster | slower | much faster | much slower
    another direction
    another count
    reverse direction with: reverse | reverse direction | back | go back
    
and the movement can be hold and resumed by:

    hold on | hold it | wait
    go on | continue
    another speed
    another direction
    another count
    
When moving, you can enter
into selection mode by calling the word "select".

Please try what happens if you start with "scrolling" (eg with _Start Scrolling down_)

When moving you can also call:
    
     begin [of] line | end [of] line | begin [of] document | end [of] document
     
 Mousing:
 
These commands work with the same mechanism as moving the cursor.  They should be worked out with more commands for practical purposes.  Start with:

:CODE:
MOUSE (MOVE | DRAG | Start Moving | Start Dragging) [<speed> | <direction> | <count>]+
::
with

:CODE:
speed = same options as above
direction = up | down | left | right (should be extended with north, north west etc)
count = same list as above
::
When mousing you are again in a so-called exclusive mode.  An icon is shown in the system tray, and mousing can be stopped by

    stop | OK
    click 
    double click
    
Moreover the movement of the mouse can be controlled by commands similar as with moving.

 Searching:
 
These commands only work after an initial search was done.  This search command is described in the grammar _general.

You can start a continuing search with:     
:CODE:
Search continue [<direction>|<count>|<speed>]+
::
with:
:CODE:
direction = forward | back
speed and count like the moving commands
::

 Repeating the last command:

These commands do NOT work in exclusive mode.  That is because they work with the HeardWord (RecognitionMimic) mechanism in which the speech engine is used recursively.

Stopping the mechanism is therefore by a general command, like Cancel or OK.

:CODE:
Repeat That <speed>
::
with
:CODE:
speed like the other commands
::
