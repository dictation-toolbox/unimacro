The grammar definition

 Basics

The basic rule should have been:

:CODE:
<keys> exported = ({norepkey} | {repkey} [{count}])+;
::

 Implementation
Because with these quasi-recursive rules there have been problems in the past (introduced several NatSpeak versions ago) this basic rule has been changed into (and enhanced with the &lt;before&gt; rule):

:CODE:
<keys> exported = <firstkey> [<stdkeys>+] ;
<firstkey> = <before>  | <stdkeys>;
<stdkeys> = ...
::

 And the further details are, including the  &lt;modifier&gt;: rule:

:CODE:
<stdkeys> = [ <modifiers> ] (<repkey>[<count>] | <norepkey>);
<repkey> =  {repkey};
<count> = {count};
<norepkey> = {character} | {norepkey} | <effkey>;
<effkey> = ( Eff|Function ) {effcount};
<modifiers>  = (Cap | 'All-Caps' | Shift | Control | Alt|halt) + ;
::

 Lists

The lists  &#123;character&#125;, &#123;effcount&#125; and &#123;count&#125; are filled in the python file. The other lists, &#123;repkey&#125; and &#123;norepkey&#125; are filled from the configuration file, so are user configurable. Even for a specific link("modes.html", "modes").
