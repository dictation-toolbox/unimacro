Grammar for Microsoft Excel

This grammar obtains specific knowledge about the running Excel instance by the link(/features/actions/actionclassesforapplications.html, action classes module for Excel).

Note: Excel can only connect to one Excel instance, if you have more instances running, you will able to do the commands only in one of them. Solution: close all Excel instances and work only from one instance.

This grammar is still work in progress. Please try "show excel" and you will see the possible commands.

Jumping to Columns is done by this grammar,

Jumping to Rows is done by the link(/grammars/globalgrammars/lines/index.html, *grammar _lines*). A *Row* is thus called *line*, unless you change the command words in the grammar lines (*edit lines*, and change the section [grammar words]).
