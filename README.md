# Installing

Unimacro is reasonably stable, but still in alpha.  Check the [Unimacro Issues](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/unimacro/issues) to see the problem
areas - probably nothing you can't live without.


## Install unimacro

Install from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
with the following.

`pip install unimacro`



# Location of Grammars

Grammars installed with Unimacro will be installed in:
the Lib\site-packages\unimacro\UnimacroGrammars sub-directory of your 
Python installation.  Good ones to start with include _folders.py and _clickbyvoice.py 
as most users will  find web and file system navigation by voice useful.
