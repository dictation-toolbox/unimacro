The python files in this folder are grammar files, which should be activated by copying or moving them into the UnimacroGrammarsDirectory, the subdirectory "ActiveGrammars" of the UnimacroUserDirectory

In this directory, UnimacroGrammars, subdirectory of the UnimacroDirectory, will contain - as much as possible - maintained Unimacro grammars 

After toggling the microphone the grammar should be active. In rare cases, this does not work. Restart Dragon in that case.

Deactivating goes the other way around, simply remove from the UnimacroGrammarsDirectory (possibly move/copy them back to this directory), and again toggle the microphone.

Note for unimacro grammar files it is also possible to activate/deactivate the grammars by voice commands as defined in _control.
